							<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Sentiment analysis is a modern task in natural language processing and linguistics. Also referred to as <em>opinion mining</em>, it deals with different kinds of affective states: opinion, emotions, stance and evaluations. Sentiment itself is the polarity of these affective states. Taking analytical articles as source material for the study, several problems should be considered. Firstly, these texts broaden the understanding of the subject of opinion, because it does not coincide with the author of the text in the majority of cases. Secondly, subjects and objects of opinion are entities – words or word combinations with strictly denoted referent. In the paper only Named Entities, that are normally expressed by proper nouns, are considered. This kind of sentiment analysis requires deeper research of possible sentiment relations between entities and of lexical and grammatical influence on these relations. The paper is devoted to the study of the influence of the group of lexemes on opinion structure. The research shows that mutual sentiment can be presented as stable patterns.</p>

										<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
									</header>

									<p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, refers to the study of opinions, evaluations, emotions and other kinds of affective states towards objects like goods, service, events or named entities. The purpose of sentiment analysis is the identification and extraction of main components of opinion and the sentiment, the polarity of the expressed opinion.<br>		The subject (or a source) of opinion is a person, expressing the opinion <a href="#references">[1-3]</a>, while the objects and situations, the opinion is expressed towards, are referred to as the object of opinion or the target of opinion. Apart from these components of opinion, a sentiment landmark, concerning that the opinion is denoted, can be included in opinion structure. Sentiment lexicon, that explicitly presents the opinion, does not always belong to the class of affective words. Factual lexemes, that express benefactive or malefactive (also referred to as good for and bad for) events, are sentiment words as well <a href="#references">[4, 5]</a>. Sentiment lexemes are recorded in special lexicons, that can be presented as lists of positive and negative words or as a more complicated resource with additional information for each unit <a href="#references">[6]</a>. Several lexicons are available for the Russian language, they differ in the approach to creation and in the words included <a href="#references">[7, 8]</a>. Another type of linguistic resource for sentiment analysis is a bank of connotation frames, that depict specific sentiment connotations for lexical units <a href="#references">[9-11]</a>.<br>		Subject of opinion in news and analytical articles may not coincide with the author, it can be expressed by an element inside the text, called the entity. The entity is a lexical unit with defined referent, possible types of entities are person, location, geopolitical unit, mass media, etc. <a href="#references">[12]</a>. In news and analytical articles entities in texts may occur on sentiment relations, but this opinion would differ from the traditional notion of evaluation in lexical and structural features. Sentiment includes evaluation and a group of other affective states as stance and attitude <a href="#references">[13-15]</a>.<br>		Lexical units may complicate opinion expression, and the interfering words are not necessary included in the class of sentiment words. The problem of sentiment inversion as a result of negation has been investigated <a href="#references">[16-19]</a>, but still the problem pf mutual or bidirectional sentiment was not yet discussed.</p>

										<h2>2. Methods</h2>
									</header>

									<p>Mutual sentiment is a situation with bidirectional sentiment attitudes between two entities with the same polarity of opinion. Considering mutual sentiment as a distinct case of opinion enables the researchers to indicate part of implicit sentiment. Thus, the problem of the representation of mutual sentiment in texts arises. Accordingly, there are two components of opinion in the same text span, while their status may be different. In some ways they may be considered as equal, on the other hand, data show that there can be examples with one entity being a more highlighted subject, although, the object reflects the opinion towards the subject. The components of opinion will be referred to as entities, as in the course of analysis only Named Entities (people, location, government etc.) were taken into consideration.</p>
									<p>There are two equal sentiment attitudes in (1). The subject of the first opinion is Turtsiya ‘Turkey’ and the object is Rossiya ‘Russia’, the second opinion represents the reversed attitude, but the polarity of opinion does not change.<p>
									<p><em>(1)	Turtsiya i Rossiya potselovalis i pomirilis.<br> ‘Turkey and Russia kissed each other and reconciled.’</em></p>
									<p>The opinions are fixed according to the components, including the subject, the object, the sentiment and the explicit sentiment expression (Table 1). Not only the sentiment is the same for both opinions, but also the sentiment expression.</p>
									<p>Mutual sentiment can be expressed explicitly by a specific group of words, that can be included in sentiment lexicons as well, for instance, <em>raznoglasie ‘disagreement’</em> and <em>sotrudnichestvo ‘cooperation’</em>. They both are the units of RuSentiLex lexicon, where they have negative and positive sentiment, respectively [8]. However, the lexicon does not represent their ability to impose bidirectional sentiment attitudes on two entities. It is to be noticed, that this information is partly implemented in connotation frames, thought they are difficult to develop.</p>
									<p>Lexemes, that impose mutual sentiment, may not be considered as affective. For example, <em>otnosheniya ‘relations’</em> imposes mutual sentiment on two entities, but lacks the polarity of opinion. Therefore, non-affective indicators of mutual sentiment need to be followed by a sentiment expression to indicate the polarity.</p>
									<p>In order to extract the examples of mutual sentiment from the data, a nuclear set of indicators of mutual sentiment was compiled by the experts, later that set was expanded. The nuclear set consisted of the words <em>otnosheniya ‘relations’, svyaz ‘connection’, sotrudnichestvo ‘cooperation’, raznoglasie ‘disagreement’</em> and <em>soyuznik ‘associate’</em>, all the words except <em>otnosheniya ‘relations’</em> were extracted from normalized texts, the normalization was done with PyMorphy2 package and included punctuation removal using regular expressions. The nuclear set was compiled by browsing the frequency dictionary, created for the corpus of analytical articles. The whole corpus consists of 120 articles or 5745 sentences, 257 sentences with words from the nuclear set were extracted, 73 of them included the word form <em>otnosheniya ‘relations’</em>. The nuclear set consists of both affective <em>(sotrudnichestvo ‘cooperation’, soyuznik ‘associate’, raznoglasie ‘disagreement’)</em> and neutral words <em>(otnosheniya ‘relations’, svyaz ‘connection’)</em>.</p>
									<p>Therefore, sentiment attitudes may not be expressed in these examples, so the further analysis was conducted manually in order to find different patterns of mutual sentiment expression. The preliminary analysis showed, that opinions in analytical texts tend to be expressed within the sentence, and that the indicators impose mutual sentiment on a limited text span, consequently, the analysis continued, and the set of indicators was expanded with the use of thesaurus of Russian RuWordNet [20]. Every source word (Table 2) was followed by its cognate words, hyponims, hyperonims and synonyms.</p>
