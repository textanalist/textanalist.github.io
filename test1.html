<p>There are 2 basic <b>Lesson page</b> types that the student will see: question pages and content pages.</p>

<p>Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,<br> That having such a scope to show her pride,<br>
The argument all bare is of more worth<br>
Than when it hath my added praise beside!<br>
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!<br>
Look in your glass, and there appears a face<br>
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,<br>
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.<br>
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,<br>
To mar the subject that before was well?<br>
For to no other pass my verses tend<br>
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;<br>
And more, much more, than in my verse can sit<br>
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.</p>
